    <p><b>The benefits of version control</b>
     </p>
    <p>
      Version control is a system to keep track of edits and changes to a project. You can save different versions of your work and it helps you to follow and reproduce changes to a project, a file or your code.
      It allows team work and collaboration as multiple people can be working on the same project without entering into conflicts, because their work can be tracked and time-stamped and a controlled version can be created.
    </p>
    <p> <p><b>How git helps to keep track of changes</b></p>

      Git runs locally on the computer and serves as a version control system. By bundling changes into save points, so called commits, you can easily track different versions and changes to your project. If necessary, the project can be reverted back to any of these commits.

    </p>
    <p><p><b>Why GitHub?</b></p>
        GitHub is an online hub, where the code or work files can be pushed/uploaded to. This allows you to work remotely or collaborate on a project with many people. When commits are being pushed to GitHub, these changes to the project can be accessed and tracked also remotely.
