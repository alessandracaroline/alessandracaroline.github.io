    <h2>The abstract random thinking style</h2>
    <p>
      According to the following personal thinking style quiz: <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">Check Your Personal Thinking Style</a>, I have an abstract random thinking style. Thus, I strive in settings that are people-oriented and unstructured and use abstract thought and intuition. Further characteristics of the abstract random thinking style are to establish good relationships with others and to like group activities. Learning is more difficult in competitive or unfriendly environments.

    <h2>My personal experience at DBC</h2>
    <p>
      From past learning experiences, I know that I can solidify my learnings best when I "force" myself into a more structured way of lerning. Although I strive in unstructured settings and achieve the same results, I can control my learnings better when structuring my progress. However, knowing that I have no problem at all when things get messy or out of structure, but that I actually enjoy working in that way, gives a lot of confidence. While coding, I actually enjoy it a lot to jump right into a problem and not have an all structured approach. I like to build different blocks simultaneously and have it all just build up and fit in nicely together. I am excited to see how this will work when we get to more complicated challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
      When working in pairs, I notice most that I have an abstract random thinking style in contrast to a concrete sequential abstract style. If the pair does not enjoy working in unstructured settings, it is even more important to have a structured approach to a challenge instead of jumping right in to the problem or building up different pieces simultaneously. The biggest difficulty for me is to be navigating as I struggle explaining my thoughts in a concrete and exact way. My approach to be overcoming this problem is to practice as much as I can. In each pairing session, I drive AND navigate. I try to check beforehand which will be the more complicated part of the challenge to be navigating and suggest to take on that part in order to challenge myself.
