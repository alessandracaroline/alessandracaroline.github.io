  <h1>Kitchen vs. Table</h1>
  <h2>The DBC learning experience</h2>

      I must say that I am really excited about immersing into the DBC experience. Not only because I will learn how to code in a super intensive, short period of time, but mainly also because of DBC's approach to teaching and learning.

      Am I going to sit at the table and let me serve with new concepts and learnings, or am I going to be a cook, experimenting and taking responsibility of my own fate? It is my wish to learn how to code and it is my decision to attend DBC, and I am very excited about it. Therefore, I want to fully immerse in the experience myself and co-create it. The perspective of a responsible cohort that takes ownership over their experience reasonates very well with me. I am especially excited about the community approach. Asking questions and seeking help is really encouraged - something would not do much normally.

        It's all a big experiment. And that is what makes it exciting. Of course I am also anxious about what is to come. For example, right now, I cannot imagine how peer pairing will work as I still do not know anything. However, I firmly believe that you mostly learn from challenges and being thrown in at the deep end. Therefore, I am trying to stay calm and positive and excited about the next weeks.
